Ques 1
Before java was introduced there were different programming languages made
for different systems and operating systems but java solved this problem by
introducing an Java Runtime Environment in the place of OSE that made it possible
to run applications and java was also supported on most of the devices,

Ques 2
JVM.) JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine that in which the programs written on one
system can be run on other computer syustems also that makes t one of the most useful feature
of the programming language.

JRE.) JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment that is required to be present on the computer
system to be able to run and execute the java programs and applications.
JRE makes the computer JRE dependent instead of being dependent on the OSE (Operating System Environment)

JDL.) JDK stands for Java Development kit which consists of the various libraries and the
requirements for development that includes various compiler files that are required forthe java
development.

Ques. 3
Java is called an portable language because of its platform independence feature that makes
ir write on any machine andd run on any machine that do not require the involvement of any
operating system but rather works in java runtime environment.

Ques. 4
Platform dependent means that an application built for a single platform can only run on
the machine that has the same platform. But if a language is platform independent, for example
if language does not depend on the OS but rather it depend on the JRE then it can run on any machine that
has JDK installed on it.

Ques. 5
In Compilation, the program is directly converted into low level language that can be
executed by the machine after the compilation.
In Interpretation the, the whole code is not converted into low level language but it is
converted one by one and error is thrown is it is there.

Ques. 6
Backward compatibility refers to keeping the older features of the language for example java 18
includes all the features of java 12 and developers can still combine and use the features of old version
in the new version of that language and java supports it.

Ques 7
float and double both are used for decimal values and the difference is in their precision like, float can hold
up to 4 decimal values while double can hold upto 8 decimal values.

Ques. 8
Java supports various types of operators such as arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, Assignment operatots,  these
operators can be used to perform various functions such as addition, comparison, etc. for example, int a=10. here = is the assignment operator.
