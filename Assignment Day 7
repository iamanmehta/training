Ques 1. What is Compile time polymorphism (Static polymorphism)?
Compile time polymorhism is also known as the static pomyorphism. It is the  type of polimorphism which is resolved during the compile time of the program. 
Overloading of methods is called through the reference variable of a class.
-------------------------------------

2. What is Run time polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism)?
Runtime polymorphism, also known as the Dynamic Method Dispatch, is a process that resolves a call to an
overridden method at runtime. The process involves the use of the reference variable of a superclass to call for an overridden method.

-------------------------------------

Ques 3.Is there any errors in the following code? Will the code compile successfully?
Yes there are 2 runtime errors in the code, but the code gets compiled successfully.
-------------------------------------

Ques 4.Will the code compile successfully? If yes, what will be the output of the program?
Yes, this program will get compiled successfully
The output of this program will be:-
m1 method in class A
m1 method in class A
m1 method in class B
m1 method in class B
m1 method in class B
-------------------------------------

Ques 5. List the types of binding in java and explain with the help of an example.
In Java, There are two types of Binding: Static and Dynamic Binding.
If the compiler maps the  method at compile-time, it is Static Binding or early binding.
and, if the method is resolved at runtime, it is Dynamic Binding or late binding.

-------------------------------------

Ques 6. Why do we need final keyword in Java?
Final keyword is used to provide a value to the vaiable that does not change after the execution.
The final keyword is useful when we want a variable to always store the same value.
for example,
final int x = 32;
-------------------------------------

Ques 7.Is there any error in the below code snippet? If not, what will be the output of the
following program?
No, there are no errors in this code, this program will get compiled successfully
The output of this program will be:-
20.
-------------------------------------

Ques 8. What is a blank final variable in Java?
A variable whose access specifier is defined as "final" and it has not been initialized and has no value.
for example,
final int x;
